To this purpose, we address some questions as how many authors we have in the dataset, distribution of articles over time, if there is a correlation between authors, hierarchical Clustering on Author-Correlation Matrix, what the main topics are, identifying frequent groups of authors, and identifying top authors in case of publishing more article.
